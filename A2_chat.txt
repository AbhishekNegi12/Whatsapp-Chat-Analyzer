	•	Only students who have classes tomorrow need to come. Those who have Monday off do not need to come.
	•	Students who usually have day timing will also need to come in the morning tomorrow.
	•	If your class ends early (e.g., 11:00 AM), you can either leave on your own or wait until 5:00 PM for the return bus.
	•	Regular classes from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM will happen as per schedule.

Please be on time and follow the instructions.

IP addresses to public IP addresses for outbound internet connectivity. Test the translation 
and examine how NAT helps conserve IPv4 address space. (Using packet Tracer)

Network Troubleshooting: Simulate network issues such as
connectivity problems, incorrect configurations, or routing failures. Use Packet Tracer's 
simulation mode to diagnose and troubleshoot the network. Procedure:

To monitor network traffic using Wire Shark Procedure:

To analyze complete TCP/IP protocol suite layer’s headers using Wire Shark

TCP Client-Server Communication:
Implement a TCP client program that sends a message to a TCP server program.
Implement the corresponding TCP server program that receives the message and displays it.
